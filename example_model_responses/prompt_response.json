    "response": " A Llama (plural: llamas or llamas) is a domesticated species of camelid native to South America, specifically the Andes region. They are closely related to alpacas, vicunas, and guanacos. Llamas are often kept as pack animals for carrying heavy loads, but they are also raised for their wool. Adult llamas typically stand about 3 feet (1 meter) tall at the shoulder and weigh between 200-450 pounds (90-200 kilograms). They have a long neck, a long nose, and a shaggy coat that comes in many different colors. Llamas are known for their gentle nature, intelligence, and ability to learn commands.",
